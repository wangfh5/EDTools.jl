A simple tool for Exact Diagonalization, supporting: 
1. hard-core bosons and fermions, with/without internal degrees of freedom (e.g., spin);
2. build-in Hamiltonian terms including hopping $c^\dagger_j c_i$, pairing $c^\dagger_i c^\dagger_j$, chemical potential $n_i$ and density interaction $n_i n_j$ (including Hubbard interaction $n_{i\uparrow} n_{i\downarrow}$). 
3. partial trace for entanglement (Renyi) entropy, and (fermionic) partial transpose for entanglement (Renyi) negativity.
